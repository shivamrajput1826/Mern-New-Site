hasError, error, and errorInfo are three things which need to be there ..
we add a error with an eventListener and remove it while it unmounts
now we show error.toString()

const error= new Error("This is an example error message");
error.toString()=>Error:This is an example error message.

errorInfo.componentStack provies a string containing a stack trace of the 
components that were in the process of rendering when as error occurred.It's the part of error
boundary mechanism 


when an error occurs during the rendering of a component , react captured the information about 
the components

errorInfo.componentStack is a string theat typically looks something like This
inComponentName(at FileName.js:lineNumber:columnNumber)
